-At this project i worked with 1 designer. After discuss with client we decided to not use any css library for unique design. I tried to put semantic codes and metatags for basic SEO. 

-At the css side, for fast code and improve my skils i prefered SASS and it was good practice about working with separeted css sheets and import them to the main design.

-For JS side our plan was only mobile menu, lightbox photo galery, accordion menu and filter buttons for photo gallery. After that we added communication info 
window when user click the lesson prices. I'm still improving my JS skills. Thats why i prefered vanilla JS and i didnt use library. All codes what i write, i sit and think about logic for a long time. :) 

-After desing and code process i did domain and host section too. Right now site is online. It was really educational and good practice.
